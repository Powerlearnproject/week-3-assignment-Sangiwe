Week 3: Grouping Your Expenses for Smarter Spending

1.1. Total Spent per Category: Write a query to find the total amount you spent in each category (Groceries, Entertainment, etc.). Hint: Use GROUP BY category and SUM(amount).

SELECT category, SUM(amount) As Total_Amount
FROM expenses
GROUP BY category;

1.2. Average Expense per Category: Now, let's see the average cost for each category. Write a query to find the average expense amount for each category. Hint: Use GROUP BY category and AVG(amount).

SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(amount),2) As Average
FROM expenses
GROUP BY category;

Bonus Challenge (Optional):
Are you curious about your top spending categories? Modify your query from Challenge 1 to show only the top 3 (or a chosen number) categories where you spend the most.

SELECT category, SUM(amount) As Total_Amount
FROM expenses
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY Total_Amount DESC
LIMIT 3;
